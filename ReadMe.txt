This script takes a stack of grayscale images of swarming B. subtilis cultures on 0.7% agar plates and roughly identifies the area of each swarm.

"cMask-swarming-analysis" is the major script that processes the images; EBI2biOps is a minor script that is called within the cMask function.

Sample data to feed into this script can be found at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6wJlSJAzF3wNV9Ha1FSNFhtNEU

The "input" folder provides the images the script needs to run, and the "output" folder provides the output files of the script on those photos.
The analysis takes 1-2hrs to run on a PC with 16GB RAM.
